<p>Hi I'm Nathan. 4th generation Phoenix, AZ native starting my journey into web development. Primarily, I have spent the last 5 years as a real estate professional working in the Affordable housing sector. At HOM inc. I was part of a $5 million initiative from the state of Arizona to help locate unit availability for housing participants suffering from homelessness. </p>

<p>In September 2023 I moved to Agoura Hills CA; which is about 1 hour north of Downtown Los Angeles. I took the oppurtunity to learn how to build my own home in a couple years. I hope to be able to document the process with this website as my knowledge grows.
  
<p>Outside of career objectives, I enjoy being outdoors. (I mean in Cali, Its a crime not to lol!) Ive started growing bamboo trees which have become a little project over time. Love to go the gym and keep my body active. My dog Riley and I made the move out here together so we have been exploring and getting used to the new area!</p>
